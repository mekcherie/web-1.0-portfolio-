            In any business firm a good leader always helps the company to better itself in so many aspects. In order to accomplish this the four function of management are needed; planning, leading, organizing and controlling. Both owners of Dunkin Brands made a significant choice, because ever since their merge the business kept growing fast, started being successful in about 5 years, which is considered as fast-growing business in general. In any existing business firm change is needed, Dunkin Brands current president (CEO) Nigel Travis, for about 6 years now and not certain if he will leave the position soon, before this position was given to him, he only set his foot three times in Dunkin Donuts, and this led to the advantage that he can start everything with a fresh eye. Travis goal is to make both restaurants more consistent and initiating. In the time he is in the business Dunkin Brands added around 3,000 more new Dunkin Donuts and Baskin Robbins, and also twelve new products like cheesecake squares, K-Cups, croissant donut and etc., he also had more new ideas to bring to Dunkin Brands and he mentioned that he is working on it. Dunkin Brands recent development is a lot but will just mention the main once and this development have a large impact on the stock market their three-year strategic plan to better growing the company, adding more locations in the U.S.(ad up to 1000 restaurants with in the next two years),  menu innovation (simplifying its menu into something much easier to access by customers) this strategic is considered as the “blueprint for growth”.
